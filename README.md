# first-project 🚀

This is my very first GitHub repository!

## 🧠 What it does
A basic starting point to get familiar with GitHub and version control.

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: A simple Python file that prints "Hello, GitHub!"

## 🎯 Goal
I'm just getting started in the world of programming and tech. I’ve recently started learning **Python**, and I’m still a beginner — but excited to learn more every day. This repo marks the beginning of my journey.
